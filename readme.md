### Input Format

User input shall be given in a json file (`/input.json`). Supported fields are:

1. `color_mode`, which represents the images should be colored or in black and white.
     Supported options are:
     1. `mono`: the images are black and white
     2. ` colored`: the images are colored

2. `canvas_width`: The width of the canvas. Default `20.0`

3. `canvas_height`: The height of the canvas. Default `20.0`

4. `layout`: The layout of the panels, given in the form of a 2-entry array.

      > Example:
      >
      > ```json
      > {
      > ...,
      > "layout":[2,2],
      > // The image will have 4 panels, 2 columns and 2 rows
      > }
      > ```
      >

5. `opacity`: the fill opacity of shapes, ranges from 0 to 1.

6. `generated_file_prefix`: the prefix of the generated files' names.

7. `composition_type`: how the individual elements on a single panel are composed.

   1. `chain`: the elements are organized in  a  chain
   2. `random`: the elements are randomly placed on the panel
   3. `radial`: several elements surrounding a central element
   4. `simple`: only one element is generated on the panel
   5. `enclosing`: will generate an enclosing image on panel

8. `sub_composition_distribution`: an json object of above options from `composition_type` as keys, and their frequencies (represented in floating numbers) as the values. This object will be used to choose how each element is generated under the rule of `composition_type`.

      > Example:
      >
      > ```json
      > {
      >     "composition_type": "random",
      >     "sub_composition_distribution":{"simple":0.5,"chain":0.5},
      >     // The top-level generation rule is random, while each sub-element have 0.5/	probability to be simple shapes or 0.5 probability to be chaining images
      > }
      > ```
      >

      *Edited:*

      `sub_composition_distribution` no longer be placed at outmost level. Instead, it should be placed in the config objects of each image generator setup, to customize for each generator and allow multi-level sub compositions

1. `color_distribution`: a list of floats of length 11, each number represents the probability of choosing the specific color as the filling color of the elements. The list of numbers should add up to 1. The mapping of each index and color is as follows:

      | Index | Color   |
      | ----- | ------- |
      | 0     | white   |
      | 1     | black   |
      | 2     | red     |
      | 3     | green   |
      | 4     | blue    |
      | 5     | cyan    |
      | 6     | magenta |
      | 7     | yellow  |
      | 8     | purple  |
      | 9     | brown   |
      | 10    | orange  |

      > Example:
      >
      > ```json
      > {
      > ...,
      > "color_distribution":[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] 
      > // The colors are evenly distributed, each with 0.1 probability
      > }
      > 
      > ```

2. `lightness_distribution`: the probability distribution for filling color's lightness:

      | Index | Lightness    |
      | ----- | ------------ |
      | 0     | lightness20  |
