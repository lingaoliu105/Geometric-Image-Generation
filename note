9.25:
1. darker outline, lighter inside, use non uniform (beta) distribution - done
2. different outline and inner color - done
3. black and white version - done
4. random number of entities (beta dist to choose number) - done
5. try how to make different pattern for overlaps - not
6. try variation on curve (or distribution) 

10.16:
1. chain variation: change control points
2. mimic existing problems

10.24 
check 8-9 age questions, try to group the questions
relationship: category based on relative interior overlap-touching-enclosed
read paper, reach out to ts


12.5:
documented, structured input (json file)

12.13
documentation of output data labels (sample image + sample annotation)
combined processes: strings(touching) in random (enclosure > random > string > enclosure) (hierachy)
controlled probability on other attributes (shapes, outline, etc.)

1.8
closer to the style(less shading, b&w, fixed styles of positioning (up&down, left&right etc))
generate and compare with the examples
fixed positioning (corner, etc) instrad of random
