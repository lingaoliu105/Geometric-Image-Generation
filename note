9.25:
1. darker outline, lighter inside, use non uniform (beta) distribution - done
2. different outline and inner color - done
3. black and white version - done
4. random number of entities (beta dist to choose number) - done
5. try how to make different pattern for overlaps - not
6. try variation on curve (or distribution) 

10.16:
1. chain variation: change control points
2. mimic existing problems

10.24 
check 8-9 age questions, try to group the questions
relationship: category based on relative interior overlap-touching-enclosed
read paper, reach out to ts


12.5:
documented, structured input (json file)

12.13
documentation of output data labels (sample image + sample annotation)
combined processes: strings(touching) in random (enclosure > random > string > enclosure) (hierachy)
controlled probability on other attributes (shapes, outline, etc.)

1.8
closer to the style(less shading, b&w, fixed styles of positioning (up&down, left&right etc))
generate and compare with the examples
fixed positioning (corner, etc) instrad of random


1.14
random control points for bezier curve - done
chain below elements - done
extend border generator: 
    linesegments from center to corner; - done
    center positioning; - done
    partial touching; - done
    shade closed region formed between line segments - done
draw outline and bg shading for panels - done
document: pic + input setup
add rectangles: length / width [1,3] and right angle triangle
linesegments strings : extend from point up/down/left/right
chaining images next element cover previous


smoother curve (random distribution around old control points)
problem : shape exceeds panel boundary
check outline for rectangles
find easier categories to generate 


accept rectangular canvas and layout (grid)
probability distribution for top level generator
add json annotation to documentation. use a offline json visualizer
annotating arbitrary shape: using matrix of 0 and 1, smallest matrix possible
